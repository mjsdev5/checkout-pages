# Checkbox

Checkbox field controlled with Formik.

## Usage

Checbox is a custom component using `useField()` which is a React Hook provided by `Formik`.
`useField()` includes the `label, <Field> and <ErrorMessage>` components which are again provided by Formik. `<Field>` components by default will render an `<input>` component that given a name prop will implicity grab the respective `onChange, onBlur, value` props and pass them to the element as well as any props we pass to it. Whever you call this component we have to add a type prop if you want to have something different that `checkbox` which is the default value.

## Checkbox

Checkbox components are used to retrieve data from users on a page and inside forms.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Checkbox">
    <Formik initialValues={{ shippingAddress: "" }}>
      <>
        <Checkbox id="shippingAddress" name="picked" type="checkbox" check>
          Use your Shipping Address
        </Checkbox>
        <Checkbox id="shippingAddress" name="picked2" type="checkbox">
          Use a different Shipping Address
        </Checkbox>
      </>
    </Formik>
  </Story>
</Preview>
