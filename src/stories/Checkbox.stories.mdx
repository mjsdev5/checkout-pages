# Checkbox

Checkbox field controlled with Formik.

## Usage

Checkbox is a custom component using `useField()` which is a React Hook provided by `Formik`.
`useField()` includes the `label, <Field> and <ErrorMessage>` components which are again provided by Formik. `<Field>` components by default will render an `<input>` component that given a name prop will implicity grab the respective `onChange, onBlur, value` props and pass them to the element as well as any props we pass to it. Whenever we call this component we have to add a few properties to make it work such as <b>id</b> (this needs to be unique if you have more than one where we use it), <b>name</b>, <b>value</b>. Also, you need to control its functionality so depending on where we use it we can pass as props the <b>checked</b> property and the <b>onClick</b> to change whenever we click it.

## Checkbox

Checkbox components are used to retrieve data from users on a page and inside forms.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="Checkbox">
    <Formik initialValues={{ shippingAddress: "" }}>
      <>
        <Checkbox
          checked={boolean("Same Shipping Address", false)}
          id="shippingAddress"
          name="picked"
          type="radio"
        >
          Use your Shipping Address
        </Checkbox>
        <Checkbox
          checked={boolean("Different Shipping Address", false)}
          id="shippingDifAddress"
          name="picked2"
          type="radio"
        >
          Use a different Shipping Address
        </Checkbox>
      </>
    </Formik>
  </Story>
</Preview>
